# About

Welcome to fred-choi.com! I, Fred Choi, created this website so that I can share with the larger community the projects I have been working on, and the things I discover along the way. I work mostly on visualization and interaction driven programs, and stick to open source principles. You will also find some non-programming related stuff, as I like to write music and do other things.

Navigate this website by typing in commands, or by using the orange links. Try typing `help` to get started. And if you find any issues, don't be silent! Please report them at https://github.com/koreanwglasses/koreanwglasses.github.io/issues

## Trivia

* I am currently an undergraduate at RPI with a 4.0, entering my last year.

* My first office job was an internship at Wayfair

* My favorite programming language is TypeScript. It combines the universality of JavaScript with the self documenting features of Java.

* I first started programming in 7th grade. Well, I tried to follow a tutorial on how to make a video game, but did not really understood how anything worked. I picked up programming again two years after reading about the RSA algorithm, which I implemented for myself in C#. 

* My favorite composer is Bach (of course), then a toss-up between Schubert, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Balakirev, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, ...(every romantic composer)

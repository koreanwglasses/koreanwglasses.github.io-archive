*Written in Java using the LibGDX Framework. Source Code: https://github.com/koreanwglasses/ndre*  

Try it out here - [4drotations.jar](/resources/assets/ndre/4drotations.jar)

*   Use 3D glasses for full effect
*   Uses keyboard controls:

*   Q and A rotate on X/Y plane
*   W and S rotate on X/Z plane
*   E and D rotate on X/W plane
*   R and F rotate on Y/Z plane
*   T and G rotate on Y/W plane
*   Y and H rotate on Z/W plane

*Thanks goes to Dr. Thomas Banchoff for his suggestions and improvements to the algorithm*

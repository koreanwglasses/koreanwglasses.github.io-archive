MusicLab is a node / connector based music experimentation software designed to be easy to use while giving the user a ton of possibilities. By taking a node / connector approach, it should be easy for the user to play around with all the different modules once they have one down. Here is some concept art of the finished design:

## Current Progress

Dr. Ron Eglash, the professor who was overseeing CSDT has left RPI to teach at U Michigan. This project will likely have no more updates.

## Previous Progress

### 4/18/18 Basic Node Connections

I wrote some code for connections between nodes. Visually its just a line, and codewise it needs a bit of cleaning up, but in general, it works!

### 4/11/18 Fourier Synthesis Module</h3>
Getting the most basic component of MusicLab implemented: the sound source module. The visual appearance might be a bit lacking for now, but it works. Next step: connections between nodes.

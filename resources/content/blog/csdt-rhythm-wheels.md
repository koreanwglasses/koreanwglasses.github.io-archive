Rhythm Wheels is simple app that makes it easy to understand modular arithmetic by placing it in the context of music / rhythms. The original can be found here: http://csdt.rpi.edu/latino/rhythm/rhy_intr.htm. It was originally written in Java as a standalone app, and it's my job to turn it into an SPA in JavaScript.

You can find the repository for this project here -> https://github.com/CSnap/CSDT_Single_Page/tree/rhythm_wheels-begin

\~\~\~ Latest Info \~\~\~

Dr. Ron Eglash, the professor who was overseeing CSDT has left RPI to teach a U Michigan. This project will likely have no more updates.

After one semester, I am at a point where I (and my boss) are happy with the product. It emulates the original, with some extra features, and the benefit of being inherently cross platform since it runs in browser. 

Next week I will be working on a new project!

This is what the original looks like:

This is what I have so far:

I'm not quite ~~there~~ anywhere yet. I just have the basic layout done (believe it or not, those triangles reflect the "sound tiles" in the original). But you can follow my progess here: https://github.com/CSnap/CSDT_Single_Page/tree/rhythm_wheels-begin
